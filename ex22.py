### WARNINGS AND TRICKS ###
'''
Remember to put # -*- coding: utf-8 -*- at the top if you use non-ASCII characters   and get an encoding error.

Add strings with + 

Use the %r for debugging, since it displays the "raw" data of the variable, but the others are used for displaying to users.

try x = int(raw_input()) which gets the number as a string from raw_input() then converts it to an integer using int().

 
command line arguments come in as strings, even if you typed numbers on the command line. Use int() to convert them just like with int(raw_input()).

cat is an old command that "con*cat*enates" files together, but mostly it's just an easy way to print a file to the screen. Type man cat to read about it.
